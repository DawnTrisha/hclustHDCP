# R Package - hclustHDCP

# Description 

This package deals with one of the classical problem in statistics, called change-point detection method. It attempts to detect abrupt significant changes in probability distributions for a sequence of observations arranged in chronological order. We implement change-point detection for high dimensional observations which works well in low sample size situation as well.
