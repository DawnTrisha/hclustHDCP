Description: Change-point detection is a classical problem in statistics with 
             various application areas such as univariate and multivariate 
             observations, even networks. Here hierarchical clustering method 
             based on linkages are applied to detect the change-points in 
             high dimensional regime. Method is applicable for both the situations 
             where the number of change-points to be detected is known as well as
             unknown.
